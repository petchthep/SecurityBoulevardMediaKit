      <h3>About</h3>
      <div class="col-md-8">

            When I founded the Security Bloggers Network and the Security Bloggers
            Meetup and Awards, it was my intention also to establish a home for the
            security community. I launched Security Boulevard with a major focus on what
            came to be known as DevSecOps. In the last three years, our “Security
            Connect: DevSecOps Edition at RSAC,” along with all of its associated activities,
            has become one of the largest gatherings in the world for DevSecOps.

            Today, we are bringing everything together in the realization of my dream.
            Security Boulevard intersects the security and the Security /DevSecOps
            communities. Lessons I have learned in publishing Security Boulevard,
            co-founding StillSecure and other activities culminate here with the launch of
            Security Boulevard.

            Launched in September 2017, SecurityBoulevard.com is quickly establishing
            itself as an indispensable resource for Security education and community
            building.

            Please have a look at the enclosed information. I hope you will join me as we
            set off on this next voyage in IT security.

      <p>A typical whitepaper describes a unique business challenge, then suggests potential solutions. Ideally the whitepaper will not only present the vendor’s business case, but also contain information that provides value independent of the vendor.
